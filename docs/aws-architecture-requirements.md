# Happy Hour Friends — AWS Architecture Requirements

A requirements brief for an AWS-architecture recommendation tool. Describes the
workload's shape and constraints, not the codebase. External SaaS integrations are
intentionally omitted — they run off-AWS and only add noise to a service recommendation.

## 1. Application profile

- SSR/ISR web app (Next.js App Router + React, Node runtime). Needs a persistent Node
  server with ISR caching and on-demand revalidation — not pure static/edge.
- Public, read-heavy pages (city/venue tables, sitemap) plus a gated `/admin` section.
- A background AI pipeline that must be decoupled from the request path.

## 2. Compute

- **Web tier:** containerized (Docker) Node service. Stateless apart from the ISR cache.
- **Orchestrator tier:** a Postgres-backed job queue running async pipeline jobs (fetch,
  AI calls, persist). Bursty but lightweight — it coordinates work rather than doing the
  heavy lifting itself. Should scale independently of the web tier.
- **On-demand render service:** a stateless function ("URL in → rendered HTML/screenshot
  out") that runs headless Chromium. This is the memory-heavy, spiky part of the workload
  (heavy during city onboarding/re-extract, idle otherwise), so it belongs in a
  scale-to-zero, pay-per-invocation service the orchestrator calls synchronously — not in
  an always-on host. Note: rendered output can exceed a synchronous response size limit
  (~6 MB), so large pages/screenshots should be written to object storage and returned by
  reference rather than inline.
- **Scheduled jobs:** nightly database backup and periodic data-reconciliation crons.
- **Current footprint:** single host, **2 vCPU / 4 GB RAM**, serving all tiers today;
  the goal is to split the render workload out first.

## 3. Data

- **PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension** — geospatial queries are load-bearing
  (boundary tiling, radius/`ST_DWithin`, point-in-polygon). A managed Postgres must
  support PostGIS.
- Relational, single primary. Read volume scales with traffic; write volume with the
  pipeline. No sharding required near-term.
- Versioned schema migrations run as a deploy step.

## 4. Object storage

- User-uploaded evidence photos plus server-side image processing. Needs blob storage
  (e.g. S3), ideally CDN-fronted. Media volume is low today and not a current priority.

## 5. Traffic & scale

- **Traffic is very low today.** Optimize for cost first, not high availability.
- Read surface is largely cacheable (mostly-static city/venue pages), so dynamic request
  rate stays modest even as content grows.
- **Product goal:** expand toward ~1000 cities. Growth is in cached content volume and
  pipeline throughput, not in concurrent dynamic traffic.

## 6. Availability / SLA

- No strict SLA at current scale; single-AZ is acceptable for now.
- Database backups: nightly, ~14-day retention (current practice). RPO/RTO are relaxed.

## 7. Geography

- Single region (US audience). A CDN handles global static/ISR asset delivery. No
  multi-region database requirement.

## 8. Storage / disk

- Not a concern at current scale; no large datasets or media catalog to plan around.

## 9. Cost posture

- **Cost-optimized.** Prefer lean managed services over premium high-availability tiers
  until traffic or an SLA justifies them.
